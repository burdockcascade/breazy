# Breasy
Breazy is an open-source framework designed to make game development in Rust accessible, fast, and fun.

Built on top of the industry-leading Bevy Engine, Breazy strips away the boilerplate of Entity Component Systems (ECS). Instead of managing queries, plugins, and systems, you get a single Context and a familiar game loop. It combines the raw performance of Bevy with the simplicity of creative coding tools like Processing or Raylib.

Whether you are building a prototype, a game jam entry, or learning Rust for the first time, Breazy lets you draw shapes, play sounds, and handle input in just a few lines of code.
